Hello World! 

My name is Edward and I am a developer for HighJump WMS. This got me working quite a bit in SQL Server and a proprietary GOTO programming interface called Architect. 

While working on HighJump projects I learned more about programming standards and practices. Or lack thereof! 

This got me very interested in learning more about programming as well as other programming languages. 

I am now teaching myself python (lpthw) and learning how to use GitHub so that I am more experienced for future projects.
